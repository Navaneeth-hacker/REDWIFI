## Usage Examples

### Basic Network Scanning

```python
from red_wifi import WiFiPentestFramework
from red_wifi.advanced_attacks import EncryptionAnalyzer

# Initialize framework
framework = WiFiPentestFramework("wlan0")
framework.initialize()

# Scan networks
networks = framework.scan_networks(duration=30)

# Analyze security
analyzer = EncryptionAnalyzer(framework.logger)
analysis = analyzer.analyze_network_security(networks)

# Display results
for network in networks:
    print(f"{network.ssid}: {network.encryption}")
```

### Automated Attack

```python
from red_wifi import WiFiPentestFramework, AutomatedAttacker, AttackMode

# Initialize
framework = WiFiPentestFramework("wlan0")
framework.initialize()

# Scan and attack
networks = framework.scan_networks()
attacker = AutomatedAttacker(framework)

# Rank targets
ranked = attacker.rank_targets(networks)
targets = [net for net, _ in ranked[:3]]

# Execute attacks
results = attacker.multi_target_attack(
    targets,
    mode=AttackMode.AGGRESSIVE,
    wordlist="rockyou.txt"
)

# Print results
for result in results:
    if result.success:
        print(f"✓ {result.target.ssid}: {result.password}")
```

### Advanced Analysis

```python
from red_wifi import EncryptionAnalyzer, AdvancedWPAAttacks
from red_wifi.advanced_attacks import VulnerabilityReportGenerator

# Create analyzer
analyzer = EncryptionAnalyzer(logger)
assessment = analyzer.analyze_network_security(networks)

# Advanced attacks
wpa_attacks = AdvancedWPAAttacks(logger)
pmkid = wpa_attacks.pmkid_attack("aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff", "wlan0")

# Generate report
reporter = VulnerabilityReportGenerator(logger)
reporter.generate_vulnerability_report(assessment)
```

### Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redwifi/red-wifi.git
cd red-wifi
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
black red_wifi/ examples/ tests/

# Lint code
flake8 red_wifi/ --max-line-length=127

# Type checking
mypy red_wifi/

# Security scan
bandit -r red_wifi/
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Monitor Mode Issues
```bash
# Check interface
sudo iwconfig

# Enable monitor mode manually
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode Monitor
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
```

### Cracking Not Working
- Verify handshake is valid: `cowpatty -r capture.cap -c`
- Check wordlist exists and is readable
- Try different cracking method (hashcat vs john)
- Check for GPU support: `nvidia-smi` (for hashcat)

### Permission Denied Errors
```bash
# Many operations require root
sudo red-wifi scan --interface wlan0
```

---

## Performance Tips

1. **For Speed**: Use Aggressive mode with hashcat GPU acceleration
2. **For Stealth**: Use Stealth mode with patient approach
3. **For Reliability**: Use Passive mode, wait longer
4. **For Cracking**: Use large, optimized wordlists
5. **For Scanning**: Use appropriate duration (30-60 seconds)

## FAQ

**Q: Is this legal to use?**  
A: Only on networks you own or have written permission to test. See security note above.

**Q: What's the success rate?**  
A: Depends on password strength, dictionary size, and encryption. Most WPA2 networks crack with appropriate wordlist.

**Q: Can it crack WPA3?**  
A: WPA3 is significantly more secure. Red WiFi supports testing but cracking is much more difficult.

**Q: How long does cracking take?**  
A: Varies from minutes to days depending on password complexity, wordlist size, and hardware.
